            Hi, I am Sufyan Chaudhry, a computer science major who is graduating from Lewis University 
            in the Chicago land area. I fell in love with coding in freshmen year of college, before that 
            I always assumed that coding was something boring and I wanted something more hands on. 
            But once exposed to it I definitely took a liking to it really fast and I think it was 
            the problem-solving part that I enjoyed the most
