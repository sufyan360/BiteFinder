                    Hi, I am Sufyan Chaudhry, a computer science major who is graduating from Lewis University 
                in the Chicago land area. I fell in love with coding in freshmen year of college, before that 
                I always assumed that coding was something boring and I wanted something more hands on. 
                But once exposed to it I definitely took a liking to it really fast and I think it was 
                the problem-solving part that I enjoyed the most.
