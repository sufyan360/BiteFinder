This project takes your location as well as your selected restaurant type and returns a web page full of restaurants. It also provides a map with markers for each location.
When you click a marker or the box with the restaurant information the marker shows which restaurant was selected. 

This program will currently not compile because I removed the API keys from this project. 

It uses Python, FLask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and multiple Google APIs.
